# Inventory-Management-Database
A Database designed for use in an Inventory Management Setting


This was the final project for Databases at San Francisco State University. It includes a relational database to be used 
on-site by workers to track shipments to customers or other locations. It will also keep track of requests made by manager 
employees who order more inventory from distributors, as well as those shipments' delivery destinations. It has a built-in 
account access hierarchy that will determine what systems different employees can access along with triggers to add those 
permissions automatically. 

Included in the repository are the documents that detail the use cases and testing tables for the final database. There is 
also an Entity Relationship Diagram which will provide an overview of the whole system. To actually use the project, there 
is a command-line-based front end implemented with Python to access features and interact with the system.
